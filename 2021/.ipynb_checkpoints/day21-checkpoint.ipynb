    "There's not much to do as you slowly descend to the bottom of the ocean. The submarine computer challenges you to a nice game of Dirac Dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game consists of a single die, two pawns, and a game board with a circular track containing ten spaces marked ```1``` through ```10``` clockwise. Each player's **starting space** is chosen randomly (your puzzle input). Player 1 goes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Players take turns moving. On each player's turn, the player rolls the die **three times** and adds up the results. Then, the player moves their pawn that many times **forward** around the track (that is, moving clockwise on spaces in order of increasing value, wrapping back around to ```1``` after ```10```). So, if a player is on space ```7``` and they roll ```2```, ```2```, and ```1```, they would move forward ```5``` times, to spaces ```8```, ```9```, ```10```, ```1```, and finally stopping on ```2```.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each player moves, they increase their **score** by the value of the space their pawn stopped on. Players' scores start at ```0```. So, if the first player starts on space ```7``` and rolls a total of ```5```, they would stop on space ```2``` and add ```2``` to their score (for a total score of ```2```). The game immediately ends as a win for any player whose score reaches **at least ```1000```**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the first game is a practice game, the submarine opens a compartment labeled **deterministic** dice and a 100-sided die falls out. This die always rolls ```1``` first, then ```2```, then ```3```, and so on up to ```100```, after which it starts over at ```1``` again. Play using this die.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given these starting positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Player 1 starting position: 4\n",
    "Player 2 starting position: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the game would go:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls ```1```+```2```+```3``` and moves to space ```10``` for a total score of ```10```.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls ```4```+```5```+```6``` and moves to space ```3``` for a total score of ```3```.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls ```7```+```8```+```9``` and moves to space ```4``` for a total score of ```14```.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls ```10```+```1```1+```12``` and moves to space ```6``` for a total score of ```9```.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls ```13```+```14```+```15``` and moves to space ```6``` for a total score of ```20```.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls ```16```+```17```+```18``` and moves to space ```7``` for a total score of ```16```.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls ```19```+```20```+```21``` and moves to space ```6``` for a total score of ```26```.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls ```22```+```23```+```24``` and moves to space ```6``` for a total score of ```22```.\n",
    "\n",
    "...after many turns...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls ```82```+```83```+```84``` and moves to space ```6``` for a total score of ```742```.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls ```85```+```86```+```87``` and moves to space ```4``` for a total score of ```990```.\n",
    "- Player 2 rolls ```88```+```89```+```90``` and moves to space ```3``` for a total score of ```745```.\n",
    "- Player 1 rolls ```91```+```92```+```93``` and moves to space ```10``` for a final score, ```1000```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since player 1 has at least ```1000``` points, player 1 wins and the game ends. At this point, the losing player had ```745``` points and the die had been rolled a total of ```993``` times; ```745 * 993 = 739785```.\n",
    "\n",
