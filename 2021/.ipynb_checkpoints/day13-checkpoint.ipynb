    "Apparently, the Elves have never used this feature. To your surprise, you manage to find the manual; as you go to open it, page 1 falls out. It's a large sheet of transparent paper! The transparent paper is marked with random dots and includes instructions on how to fold it up (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "The first section is a list of dots on the transparent paper. ```0,0``` represents the top-left coordinate. The first value, ```x```, increases to the right. The second value, ```y```, increases downward. So, the coordinate ```3,0``` is to the right of ```0,0```, and the coordinate ```0,7``` is below ```0,0```. The coordinates in this example form the following pattern, where ```#``` is a dot on the paper and . is an empty, unmarked position:\n",

Each instruction indicates a line on the transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper up (for horizontal ```y=...``` lines) or left (for vertical ```x=...``` lines).
