    "As you leave the cave and reach open waters, you receive a transmission from the Elves back on the ship.\n",

    "The transmission was sent using the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (BITS), a method of packing numeric expressions into a binary sequence. Your submarine's computer has saved the transmission in hexadecimal (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of decoding the message is to convert the hexadecimal representation into binary. Each character of hexadecimal corresponds to four bits of binary data:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 = 0000\n",
    "1 = 0001\n",
    "2 = 0010\n",
    "3 = 0011\n",

    "The BITS transmission contains a single **packet** at its outermost layer which itself contains many other **packets**. The hexadecimal representation of this packet might encode a few extra 0 bits at the end; these are not part of the transmission and should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every packet begins with a standard header: the first three bits encode the packet **version**, and the next three bits encode the packet **type ID**. These two values are numbers; all numbers encoded in any packet are represented as binary with the most significant bit first. For example, a version encoded as the binary sequence ```100``` represents the number ```4```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packets with type ID ```4``` represent a **literal value**. Literal value packets encode a single binary number. To do this, the binary number is padded with leading zeroes until its length is a multiple of four bits, and then it is broken into groups of four bits. Each group is prefixed by a ```1``` bit except the last group, which is prefixed by a ```0``` bit. These groups of five bits immediately follow the packet header. For example, the hexadecimal string ```D2FE28``` becomes:\n",

    "- The three bits labeled ```T``` (```100```) are the packet type ID, ```4```, which means the packet is a literal value.\n",
    "- The five bits labeled ```A``` (```10111```) start with a ```1``` (not the last group, keep reading) and contain the first four bits of the number, ```0111```.\n",
    "- The five bits labeled ```B``` (```11110```) start with a ```1``` (not the last group, keep reading) and contain four more bits of the number, ```1110```.\n",
    "- The five bits labeled ```C``` (```00101```) start with a ```0``` (last group, end of packet) and contain the last four bits of the number, ```0101```.\n",
    "- The three unlabeled ```0``` bits at the end are extra due to the hexadecimal representation and should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this packet represents a literal value with binary representation ```011111100101```, which is ```2021``` in decimal.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "An operator packet contains one or more packets. To indicate which subsequent binary data represents its sub-packets, an operator packet can use one of two modes indicated by the bit immediately after the packet header; this is called the **length type ID**:\n",
